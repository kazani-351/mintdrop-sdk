# useTiming

Hook to provide countdown abilities for a date in the future.

```tsx
import { useTiming } from "@mintdrop/sdk"
```

## Usage

```tsx
import dayjs from "dayjs"
import { useBlockBeat } from "@mintdrop/sdk"

// next day
const when = dayjs()
  .add(dayjs.duration({ days: 1 }))
  .toDate()

const Countdown = () => {
  const timing = useTiming(when)

  return (
    <div>
      <label>Returns</label>
      <pre>{JSON.stringify({ ...timing, diff: "() => {}" }, null, 2)}</pre>
      <p>
        <code>now</code> {timing.now.format("LLL")}
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>complete</code> {JSON.stringify(timing.complete)}
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Returns

```json
{
  now: Dayjs
  diff: Duration
  complete: boolean
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with smart contracts, it is not enought to simply rely on the user's time (aka system clock). This can easily be faked and moved into the future and if they try and send a mint transaction, it will fail.
